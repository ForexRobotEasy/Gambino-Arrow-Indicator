# Gambino Arrow Indicator ReadMe

## Description

The Gambino Arrow Indicator is a trading tool developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to identify mid-week market structure reversals and generate signals based on the dominant weekly trend.

This indicator calculates the dominant weekly trend by analyzing the high and low prices of the previous week. It then compares the current closing price to the weekly range, multiplied by the user-defined RiseFallLevel parameter. If the closing price is above the upper threshold, it indicates an upward trend. If the closing price is below the lower threshold, it indicates a downward trend. If the closing price is within the thresholds, it indicates a sideways trend.

When a mid-week reversal occurs, the indicator generates a signal in the form of an arrow. Up arrows indicate an upward trend, down arrows indicate a downward trend, and no arrow indicates a sideways trend.

## Input Parameters

- RiseFallLevel: Number of levels of rise or fall before a reversal can occur. Default value is 3.
